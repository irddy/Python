If you think the game cannot end, it is because it is designed to do so. However not everyone will be patient enough to look at this other file. 
So, in the end it is just a pointless loop that doesn't end. 
The purpose of that is simple. 

I left every focused player in cliffhanger.
While explaining to them how they could change and think outside of the box, I challenged them. 
The purpose of the game is not to find out who is the winner. 

The game is infinite. The players are infinite. My rules are not your rules. So there is never a winner. 
Just someone better at a certain point in time. 
The purpose is to stay in the game until somone runs out of resources to play. 

In our game that resource is the entirety of your life events/memories/struggles/achievements etc.
Then the player is advised to use this game as an opportunity to learn to improve, and to grow up and to most importantly...

I did not tell them the most important thing. 

Pro Tip: Remove line 164 in the source code. You will understand. 

Thank you for coming to the game. â™¥
